## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run an application on your local machine.
One way is to execute the `main` method in the `com/tefo/bank/transactionsservice/TransactionsServiceApplication.java` class from your IDE.
